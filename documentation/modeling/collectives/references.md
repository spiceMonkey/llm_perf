### Known numerical caveats (documented in-line)

- The $\alpha$ values used in worked examples ($\alpha = 0.5\,\mu$s intra-NVLink, $\alpha \approx 1\,\mu$s inter-domain) are order-of-magnitude estimates consistent with NVSwitch cut-through (~100 ns) + endpoint software floor (~800 ns). Exact values depend on the NCCL path chosen at runtime; the model's conclusions are robust to $\pm 2\times$ variation on $\alpha$ because the bandwidth term dominates for $M \geq$ few hundred KB.
- The A2A on star entries in `02_topology_mapping.md` §2.5 and §5.1 use the per-rank pairwise direct-send formula (NVSwitch aggregate bisection saturated), appropriate for MoE workloads where all ranks participate simultaneously.
