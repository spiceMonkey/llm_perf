# 1. Memory Footprint

This section defines parameter sizes and memory footprint for a given set of model parameters. The memory footprint include those from model weights, per-token activation/working memories, and KV cache. We avoid model-wide parameter aggregation here and instead focus on **per-layer** quantities, because pipeline-parallel stages own disjoint sets of layers. All parameter definitions assume stored precision of $b$ bytes per element (e.g., bf16 = 2 bytes).

---

## 1.0 Parameter Definitions (P vs W)

For any weight matrix $W$, the parameter count is

$$
P(W) = \text{number of elements in } W
$$

Total stored parameter memory is

$$
M_\theta = P \cdot b
$$

---

## 1.1 Model Parameter Memory

### Embedding and LM Head Parameters

Modern LLM architectures (GPT-3/4, LLaMA families, PaLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.) typically use embedding dimension $E = H$, so all internal projections operate on vectors in $\mathbb{R}^H$.

For the token embedding:

$$
W_{\text{emb}} \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times H},
\quad
P_{\text{emb}} = V H
$$

If the LM head is tied with embeddings, i.e. $W_{lm}=W_{emb}^T$ so that $W_{emb}$ can be re-used:

$$
P_{\text{lm}} = 0
$$

If untied:

$$
W_{\text{lm}} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times V},
\quad
P_{\text{lm}} = V H
$$

### Attention Parameters

For hidden size $H$, head dimension $d_{\text{head}}$, and KV dimension $H_{kv} = n_{kv} \, d_{\text{head}}$ (supporting grouped-query attention where $n_{kv} \le n_q$ [GQA] and multi-query attention where $n_{kv} = 1$ [MQA]):

- $W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times H}$  
- $W_K \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times H_{kv}}$  
- $W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times H_{kv}}$  
- $W_O \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times H}$  

In GQA, each of the $n_q$ query heads produces a $d_{\text{head}}$-dimensional output; the concatenated result across all query heads is $n_q \times d_{\text{head}} = H$-dimensional, regardless of how many KV heads are used. The output projection therefore always maps $\mathbb{R}^H \to \mathbb{R}^H$.

Parameter counts:

$$
P_Q = H^2, \qquad
P_K = H H_{kv}, \qquad
P_V = H H_{kv}, \qquad
P_O = H^2
$$

We define attention parameters:

$$
P_{\text{attn}} = P_Q + P_K + P_V + P_O
$$

### Unified FFN Parameters (Dense or MoE)

Each transformer layer contains an FFN module. In modern LLM architectures, this FFN is almost
always implemented as a gated MLP (GeLU/SiLU/GLU/SwiGLU–style) with **three** linear projections:

- a gate projection,
- an “up” projection (expansion),
- a “down” projection (contraction).

> **Convention:** This document assumes **gated FFN (SwiGLU/GeGLU style) throughout**, giving three weight matrices per FFN block. Standard (non-gated) FFN uses two matrices (up + down), yielding $2HI$ parameters. The gated form is used by LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, and most modern LLMs.

For a hidden size $H$ and FFN intermediate dimension $I$, this yields an FFN parameter count

$$
P_{\text{FFN}} = 3 H I N_{\text{exp}}.
$$

Here $N_{\text{exp}}$ denotes the number of experts **per layer**:

- **For a dense MLP model:** $I = I_{\text{dense}}, \; N_{\text{exp}} = 1$.
- **For a MoE model:** $I = I_{\text{moe}}$, with $N_{\text{exp}} > 1$.

These two model cases are mutually exclusive **per layer**.

### LayerNorm parameters

LayerNorm or RMSNorm contain $\mathcal{O}(H)$ parameters (scale and optional bias). These are negligible compared to attention and FFN weights and are omitted in scaling formulas.

---

## 1.2 Activation Memory (Per-token Working Memory)

During autoregressive decoding, the model processes **one token at a time**. As a result, the only activations that need to be stored in memory are the **temporary, layer-local working buffers** used in the forward pass of the *current token*.  

These activations are **not reused** across layers or across tokens and therefore are:

- **not dependent on sequence length** $S$,
- **proportional to batch size** $B$ (each sequence in the batch needs its own working buffers),
- **not EP- or TP-sharded**,  
- and **extremely small** relative to model parameter memory (Section 1.1) and KV cache memory (Section 1.3).

Below we account for all activation tensors in a model layer that must be alive **concurrently** for one decoding token.

### Q, K, V projections

For the current hidden state $h \in \mathbb{R}^{H}$, the layer computes:

- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{H}$
- $K \in \mathbb{R}^{H_{kv}}$
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{H_{kv}}$

This contributes:

$$
H + 2H_{kv}
$$

### Attention score accumulation buffer (FlashAttention-like kernels)

Attention score computation normally requires a temporary buffer. FlashAttention-style fused kernels avoid storing full $S$-length score vectors and instead use a **single internal workspace** of size $H$ during streaming softmax.

This adds:

$$ + H
$$

### Attention output buffer

After applying attention weights to $V$ and combining across heads, we form the attention output $O_{\text{attn}} \in \mathbb{R}^{H}$.

This output must exist before the output projection is applied, contributing:

$$+ H$$

### FFN working buffer

Following attention and normalization, the FFN block needs at least one temporary buffer of size $H$ to hold either the FFN input or the FFN output before residual addition. Even with kernel fusion, this buffer cannot always overlap with the attention intermediates.

This adds:

$$+ H$$

Summing all simultaneously required buffers per sequence:

$$
P_{\text{act}} = 4H + 2H_{kv}
$$

In bytes, for a batch of $B$ sequences:
$$
M_{\text{act,layer}} = B \cdot (4H + 2H_{kv}) \cdot b
$$

This footprint is **small** compared to parameter memory and KV cache, even at large batch sizes. For example, at $B=128$, $H=8192$, $H_{kv}=1024$, $b=2$: $M_{\text{act,layer}} \approx 9$ MB per layer — negligible against hundreds of GB of parameter memory.

---

## 1.3 KV Cache Memory

Section 1.1 described the memory footprint of model parameters (static), and Section 1.2 covered the
activation memory required during decoding (per-token, dynamic). This section describes the **KV cache**, which is a *runtime* structure generated during the **pre-fill phase**, when the model processes the entire input sequence of length $S$.

During pre-fill, each attention layer produces:

- one key vector of dimension $H_{kv}$,
- one value vector of dimension $H_{kv}$,

for each input token. Because decoding adds only one new token at a time, the vast majority of KV memory comes from **pre-fill**, not decoding.

For a single attention layer, the KV cache consists of:

- Keys: $K \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times H_{kv}}$  
- Values: $V \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times H_{kv}}$

The KV cache size scales with $H_{kv} = n_{kv} d_{\text{head}}$; using grouped-query attention ($n_{kv} < n_q$) [GQA] or multi-query attention ($n_{kv} = 1$) [MQA] directly reduces this footprint.

Thus, the total KV elements for one layer are:

$$
P_{KV, layer} = S \cdot (2H_{kv}) = 2 S H_{kv}
$$

In bytes (per sequence):

$$
M_{\text{KV,layer}} =
2 S H_{kv} \cdot b \quad \text{(per sequence, per layer)}
$$

This is **static** once pre-fill is complete; decoding contributes only an additional $2H_{kv} b$ per
generated token, which is negligible relative to the full cache.

## 1.4 Per-device Memory Footprint After Parallelism Sharding

So far we've completed the all the memory footprint estimation for a model layer. When we introduce different parallelism schemes, some of these memories would be sharded by one or more of these parallelism dimensions, resulting in a somewhat complicated memory aggregateion per device. We now describe how these parameters are distributed across devices under PP/EP/TP/SP, and then derive simple modeling approximations.

### Per-device Parameter Memory (TP, EP, PP)

Each transformer layer has two parameter groups:

- **Attention parameters** $P_{\text{attn}}$, that are sharded by **tensor parallelism (TP)** only.
- **FFN parameters** $P_{\text{FFN}}$ are sharded by **TP and EP**.
  Dense FFN layers are treated as a special case with $EP = 1$, so the same formula applies to both dense and MoE FFNs.

For a *single layer* on a device, the stored parameter memory is

$$
M_{\theta,\text{layer}} =
\frac{P_{\text{attn}}\, b}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{P_{\text{FFN}}\, b}{TP \cdot EP}
$$

Pipeline parallelism (PP) assigns **disjoint sets of layers** to different stages. Let $L_s$ be the set of layers that live on PP stage $s$, and let $M_{\theta,\text{layer},\ell}$ be the per-layer memory from the expression above.

Excluding embeddings and LM head, the parameter memory per device on PP stage $s$ is

$$
M_{\theta,\text{layers}}^{(s)} =
\sum_{\ell \in L_s}
M_{\theta,\text{layer},\ell}
$$

Embeddings and LM head appear only on two stages:

- **Intermediate PP stages** (no embedding / LM head):
  $$
  M_{\theta,\text{device}}^{(\text{mid})} =
  M_{\theta,\text{layers}}^{(\text{mid})}
  $$

- **First PP stage** (with token embedding):
  $$
  M_{\theta,\text{device}}^{(1)} =
  M_{\theta,\text{layers}}^{(\text{mid})}
  \;+\;
  \frac{P_{\text{emb}}\, b}{TP}
  $$

- **Final PP stage** (with LM head):
  $$
  M_{\theta,\text{device}}^{(\text{PP})} =
  M_{\theta,\text{layers}}^{(\text{mid})}
  \;+\;
  \frac{P_{\text{lm}}\, b}{TP}
  $$

If each intermediate PP stage holds approximately $L/PP$ layers of similar size, and we use representative per-layer values $P_{\text{attn}}$ and $P_{\text{FFN}}$, then

$$
M_{\theta,\text{device}}^{(\text{mid})} =
\frac{L}{PP} M_{\theta,\text{layer}} =
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
+
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b
$$

For capacity planning we use a worst-case PP stage budget, adding one $\frac{VH}{TP}b$ term to account for embedding/LM weights residing on boundary stages. Intermediate stages are slightly smaller. Therefore:

$$
M_{\theta,\text{device}} =
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b
+\frac{VH}{TP} b
$$

For a **dense MLP model**: $I = I_{\text{dense}}$, and $N_{\text{exp}} = EP = 1$.

For a **MoE model**: $I = I_{\text{moe}}$, with $N_{\text{exp}} > 1$ and $EP \ge 1$.

### Mixed MoE/Dense Architectures

Many modern architectures use a **mixed** design where only some layers are MoE (e.g., alternating dense and MoE layers, or MoE only in deeper layers). For such models, the parameter memory must be computed separately for dense and MoE layers:

$$
M_{\theta,\text{device}} =
M_{\theta,\text{dense}} + M_{\theta,\text{moe}} + \frac{VH}{TP} b
$$

where:

$$
M_{\theta,\text{dense}} =
\frac{L_{\text{dense}}}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I_{\text{dense}}}{TP}
\right) b
$$

$$
M_{\theta,\text{moe}} =
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I_{\text{moe}} N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b
$$

Note that dense layers use $EP = 1$ and $N_{\text{exp}} = 1$ implicitly, while MoE layers use the specified $EP$ and $N_{\text{exp}}$ values.

### Per-device Activation Memory

The per-layer working activation footprint for a batch of $B$ sequences is $B \cdot (4H + 2H_{kv})$.

In standard sequential layer execution, only one layer's activation buffers are live at any time —
each layer's output overwrites the previous layer's buffer before the next layer begins. The $L/PP$ multiplier therefore does *not* appear: earlier layers' activations are not retained while later layers execute. A $2\times$ factor could apply when double-buffering for PP communication overlap, but this is negligible in practice and omitted.

The per-device activation memory during decoding is therefore one layer's worth:

$$
M_{\text{act,device}}(B) =
B \cdot (4H + 2H_{kv}) \, b
$$

### Per-device KV Cache Memory

Only attention layers produce KV cache.  
The KV cache is sharded only across:

- **TP** — splits the channel dimension $H_{kv}$,  
- **SP** — splits the sequence dimension $S$.

EP and DP do not modify KV layout; PP only affects how many layers are assigned to a stage.

For a batch of $B$ resident sequences, each carries its own KV history. The **per-device** KV memory footprint scales linearly with $B$:

$$
M_{\text{KV,device}}(B) =
B \cdot \frac{L}{PP}
\frac{
    M_{\text{KV,layer}}
}{
    TP \cdot SP
} =
B \cdot \frac{L}{PP}
\frac{
     (2 S H_{kv}) b
}{
    TP \cdot SP
}
$$

which:

- Scales linearly with $B$ — every active sequence in the batch holds its own KV cache.
- For long-context inference (e.g., $S \in [16\text{k}, 128\text{k}]$), $B \cdot S(2H_{kv})b$ is large enough that KV can exceed parameter memory unless aggressively reduced through TP and SP.
- Each decoded token adds only $2H_{kv} b$ per sequence, which is negligible compared to the pre-fill KV footprint.

### Total Per-device Static Memory Footprint

Summing all the memory footprint we derive from section 1.1 - 1.4 together, we can therefore get the "minimum required" memory size for the device to host the model under a particular PP/EP/TP/SP partition.

$$
M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}}(B) = M_{\theta,\text{device}} + M_{\text{act,device}}(B) + M_{\text{KV,device}}(B)
$$

Note: $M_{\theta,\text{device}}$ is $B$-independent (weights are loaded once and shared across all sequences in the batch); $M_{\text{act,device}}(B)$ and $M_{\text{KV,device}}(B)$ both scale linearly with $B$.

For **uniform architectures** (all dense or all MoE):

$$
M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}} =
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\left[
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
+
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right] b
+
B \cdot \frac{L}{PP} \cdot \frac{2 S H_{kv}}{TP \cdot SP} \cdot b
+
B(4H + 2H_{kv}) b
+\frac{VH}{TP} b
$$

For a dense model: $I = I_{\text{dense}}, \text{ } N_{\text{exp}}=EP=1$

And for a MoE model: $I = I_{\text{moe}}$

For **mixed MoE/dense architectures** (where $L_{\text{moe}} < L$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}} = \;&
\frac{L_{\text{dense}}}{PP}\;
\left[
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
+
\frac{3 H I_{\text{dense}}}{TP}
\right] b \\
+\;&
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}\;
\left[
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
+
\frac{3 H I_{\text{moe}} N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right] b \\
+\;&
B \cdot \frac{L}{PP} \cdot
\frac{2 S H_{kv}}{TP \cdot SP}
\cdot b \\
+\;&
B(4H + 2H_{kv}) b
+\frac{VH}{TP} b
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: Activation memory ($B(4H+2H_{kv})b$, one layer at a time) and KV cache apply to all $L$ layers. KV cache uses the total layer count $L/PP$ since all layers' KV tensors are concurrently resident.

# 2. Memory Traffic During Decoding

Section 1 quantified the *static* memory footprint of the model — how many bytes of parameters, KV cache, and activations must **fit** in device HBM.

This section instead focuses on **memory traffic per decode step**, i.e., the bytes that must flow between HBM and compute cores during decoding. This traffic directly determines the memory-bound component of decoding performance (Section 4's roofline model).

**Crucial Distinction for Decoding:**
In autoregressive decoding, each step generates one new token per active sequence (B tokens per step for a batch of B). Unlike prefill — where weights are loaded once and reused across $S_{\text{input}}$ tokens within a single pass — decoding reloads the **entire model weight matrix** from HBM **every step**, regardless of $B$. KV cache, by contrast, is read per-sequence: each of the $B$ active sequences streams its own KV history. So per step:

- **Weight traffic** ($T_{\theta,\text{device}}$): independent of $B$ (loaded once, shared across all $B$ tokens — equivalently, per-token weight traffic = $T_{\theta,\text{device}}/B$ shrinks as $B$ grows).
- **KV traffic**: scales linearly with $B$ (each sequence reads its own history).

Throughout this section, the per-step traffic quantities below are consistent with this asymmetry. Optimizations like FlashAttention or Fused-MLP do **not** reduce weight traffic; they only reduce the traffic of intermediate activations.

---

## 2.1 Model Parameter Traffic $T_{\theta,\text{device}}$

Following Section 1, we use:

- $P_{\text{attn}}$: Q/K/V/O projection parameters  
- $P_{\text{FFN}}$: dense FFN (or non-expert MoE core) parameters  

$P_{\text{emb}}$ is small (one row read per token) and absorbed into the embedding lookup overhead — we drop it from the steady-state traffic model. $P_{\text{lm}}$ is **kept** as a stage-PP-1-only term (see "LM head parameter traffic" below) — it can rival ~10% of the body for large $V$ and warrants explicit accounting.

### Attention parameter traffic

Because $P_{\text{attn}}$ is defined **per layer**, a PP stage with $L_{\text{stage}} = L/PP$ layers has $L_{\text{stage}} P_{\text{attn}}$ attention parameters. These are sharded across $TP$ devices.

Since every weight must be read per token:

$$
T_{\theta,\text{attn}} =
\frac{L}{PP}
\cdot
\frac{P_{\text{attn}} \, b}{TP}
$$

### FFN parameter traffic

Similarly, the FFN parameters $P_{\text{FFN}}$ are sharded by both **TP** and **EP**. Although fused kernels (e.g., FlashMLP) avoid writing intermediate activations (like the gate tensor) to HBM, they still require reading the gate, up, and down projection weights fully.

$$
T_{\theta,\text{FFN}} =
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\frac{P_{\text{FFN}}}{TP \cdot EP}\; b
$$

### Final parameter-traffic expression

Combining these terms:

$$
T_{\theta,\text{device}}
\approx
\frac{L}{PP}
\left(
  \frac{P_{\text{attn}}}{TP}
  +
  \frac{P_{\text{FFN}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b =
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b
$$

**For a dense MLP model:** $I = I_{\text{dense}}, \text{ } N_{\text{exp}} = EP = 1$

**And for a MoE model:** $I = I_{\text{moe}}$

### Mixed MoE/Dense Architectures

For mixed architectures, parameter traffic is computed separately for dense and MoE layers:

$$
T_{\theta,\text{device}} =
T_{\theta,\text{dense}} + T_{\theta,\text{moe}}
$$

where:

$$
T_{\theta,\text{dense}} =
\frac{L_{\text{dense}}}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I_{\text{dense}}}{TP}
\right) b
$$

$$
T_{\theta,\text{moe}} =
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}\;
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I_{\text{moe}} N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b
$$

### LM head parameter traffic

The LM head ($H \to V$ projection) is **column-parallel sharded by TP** across the vocab dimension and **lives only on the last PP stage** (stage $PP{-}1$). It is not divided by $PP$, $EP$, or $SP$. The per-step weight read on stage $PP{-}1$ is:

$$
T_{\text{LM},\theta,\text{device}} = \frac{V H \, b}{TP} \quad \text{(stage } PP{-}1 \text{ only)}
$$

Because the LM head fires once per step (not per layer), it is bookkept as a separate additive term rather than folded into the per-layer $T_{\theta,\text{device}}$. The roofline composition in §6 / §7 adds $t_{\text{LM}}$ on top of the per-stage body cost; on stages $0..PP{-}2$ this term is zero.

Section 1 showed that the per-layer activation footprint for a single decoding token is small. However, without optimization, the traffic to read/write these activations—especially the $S \times S$ attention scores—would be massive ($O(S^2)$).

### The Role of FlashAttention

**FlashAttention** [FA1, FA2] avoids materializing the $S \times S$ score matrix in HBM by streaming the tiled attention computation through on-chip SRAM. More precisely: Q, K, V reads remain $O(SH)$; the $O(S^2 d^2 / M)$ score matrix IO (per [FA1] Theorem 2, where $d = d_{\text{head}}$ and $M$ is SRAM size) is reduced to $O(S^2 d / \sqrt{M})$ via tiling, compared to $O(S^2 d)$ for standard attention. For large $S$ and modern GPU SRAM sizes, this makes the $O(S^2)$ term negligible and leaves KV reads as the dominant activation traffic.

Because FlashAttention drastically reduces the score matrix traffic, the residual activation traffic (hidden-state loads/stores, FFN buffers) is $O(H)$ per layer — negligible compared to the weight and KV cache terms for large models. We drop $T_{\text{act,device}}$ from the traffic model here. Residual kernel-level activation overhead is treated as an empirical correction in `framework.md`.

---

## 2.3 KV Cache Traffic $T_{\text{KV,device}}$

KV cache must be **fully read** for each new token to compute attention against the history.
For large $S$, the write term (appending the new token) is negligible compared to reading the history.

The per-sequence per-layer KV access is approximately:

$$
T_{\text{KV,layer}}
\approx
2 S H_{kv} \, b \quad \text{(per sequence, per layer)}
$$

Consistent with Section 1, KV is sharded by **TP** (channel/head dimension) and **SP** (sequence dimension). Thus each device only sees a $\frac{1}{TP \cdot SP}$ shard of this per-layer traffic.

For a PP stage with $L/PP$ layers and $B$ active sequences in the batch — each streaming its own KV history — the **per-step per-device KV traffic** is:

$$
T_{\text{KV,device}}(B)
\approx
B \cdot \frac{L}{PP}
\cdot
\frac{2 S H_{kv} \, b}{TP \cdot SP}
$$

The linear $B$ scaling reflects that each sequence in the batch reads its own KV cache independently. FlashAttention does **not** reduce this term: keys and values from history must always be loaded to compute each sequence's current-token attention, regardless of tiling strategy.

---

## 2.4 Total and Effective Traffic

Combining the expressions derived in Sections 2.1–2.3 (with activation traffic dropped as negligible), the **effective** total per-step traffic is:

$$
T_{\text{step,device}}^{\text{eff}}(B)
\approx
T_{\theta,\text{device}}
+
T_{\text{KV,device}}(B)
$$

Weight traffic is $B$-independent (one load per step); KV traffic scales linearly with $B$. Substituting yields the **final fully expanded expression**:

$$
T_{\text{step,device}}^{\text{eff}}(B)
\;\approx\;
\underbrace{\frac{L}{PP}
\left(
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
+
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\right) b}_{T_{\theta,\text{device}}\ \text{(weights, once per step)}}
\;+\;
\underbrace{B \cdot \frac{L}{PP} \cdot \frac{2 S H_{kv}}{TP \cdot SP} b}_{T_{\text{KV,device}}(B)\ \text{(KV, per sequence)}}
$$

The first group is **weight traffic** (loaded once per step regardless of $B$), and the second is **KV cache traffic** (each of the $B$ active sequences reads its own history).

## 2.5 Static Memory Footprint vs. Memory Traffic (Important Distinction)

Sections 1 and 2 play different roles in the overall performance model:

**Static Memory Footprint (Section 1)** Determines whether a $(DP, PP, EP, TP, SP)$ configuration can *fit* on a device (Capacity Constraint)

$$
M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}} \le M_{\text{HBM}}
$$

**Memory Traffic (Section 2)** Determines the *bandwidth-limited latency* per decode step (Bandwidth Constraint)

$$
t_{\text{mem}}(B) =
\frac{T_{\text{step,device}}^{\text{eff}}(B)}
     {BW_{\text{mem}}}
$$

This distinction is critical: Section 1 tells us **which parallelism configurations are viable**, while Section 2 tells us **how fast decoding can proceed** for those viable configurations.

# 3. Compute (FLOPs) per Token

During inference, the FLOPs required to generate a token depend on the transformer layer structure. We distinguish between:

- **Prefill FLOPs (GEMM-dominant):** $O(S^2)$ across the full input sequence  
- **Decoding FLOPs (GEMV-dominant):** $O(S)$ for one additional token  

This section focuses on **decoding FLOPs**, which determine TPS throughput. All FLOPs below represent **per-token**, **per-layer**, **decoding** FLOPs.

---

## 3.1 Q/K/V and Output Projections

Q, K, and V projections are vector–matrix multiplications of shapes:

- Q: $[1 \times H] \cdot [H \times H]$  
- K: $[1 \times H] \cdot [H \times H_{kv}]$  
- V: $[1 \times H] \cdot [H \times H_{kv}]$  
- Output: $[1 \times H] \cdot [H \times H]$

### Projection FLOPs

$$
F_Q = 2H^2, \qquad
F_K = 2H H_{kv}, \qquad
F_V = 2H H_{kv}, \qquad
F_O = 2H^2.
$$

Where the factor 2 accounts for each multiply-accumulate pair in the standard GEMV convention.

### Total

$$
F_{\text{proj}} = 4H^2 + 4H H_{kv}
$$

If $H_{kv} = H$ (MHA), this reduces to $8H^2$.

## 3.2 Attention Scores and Value Application

During decoding, the newly generated token attends to all $S$ cached tokens in the KV cache for this layer. Conceptually, for each layer we can treat the cached keys and values as:

- $K_{\text{cache}} \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times H_{kv}}$  
- $V_{\text{cache}} \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times H_{kv}}$,

where $H_{kv} = n_{kv} d_{\text{head}}$ is the total KV projection dimension.

### Scores (Q · Kᵀ)

Each of the $n_q$ query heads independently computes a dot product against its corresponding (broadcast) KV head over $S$ cached positions. Per query head: $2 d_{\text{head}} S$ FLOPs. Summed over all $n_q$ query heads:

$$
F_{\text{score}} = 2 \, n_q \, d_{\text{head}} \, S = 2 S H
$$

> **GQA note:** In GQA ($n_{kv} < n_q$), each KV head is shared by $n_q / n_{kv}$ query heads [GQA]. The KV cache **memory** scales with $H_{kv}$ (only $n_{kv}$ unique heads are stored), but the attention **FLOPs** scale with $H$ because every query head independently computes attention scores and value-weighted sums.

### Value application (Attn · V)

After applying softmax to the scores, each of the $n_q$ query heads computes a weighted sum over the $S$ cached values of its corresponding value head. Per head: $2 d_{\text{head}} S$ FLOPs. Total:

$$
F_{\text{value}} = 2 S H
$$

### Total KV attention FLOPs

Combining the two:

$$
F_{\text{attn,KV}} = F_{\text{score}} + F_{\text{value}} = 4 S H
$$

This term captures the **sequence-length-dependent** attention cost during decoding. For MHA ($n_{kv} = n_q$, $H_{kv} = H$), this is numerically identical to the older $4SH_{kv}$ formulation; the distinction matters for GQA/MQA models where $H_{kv} < H$.

## 3.3 FFN FLOPs (Unified Dense + MoE)

To match the parameter definitions in Section 1.1, we express FFN FLOPs using a **unified formulation** that works for both dense FFN layers and MoE layers.

### Dense FFN FLOPs

For a gated FFN (the convention assumed throughout; see §1.1), a dense FFN consists of three GEMVs:

- a gate projection: $H \rightarrow I$,
- an up projection: $H \rightarrow I$, and
- a down (contraction) projection: $I \rightarrow H$.

Each GEMV costs $2HD$ FLOPs, giving:

$$
F_{\text{ffn,dense}} = 6 H I_{dense}
$$

> **Convention note — gated MLPs:** §1.1 counts **three** weight matrices for a gated FFN (gate, up, and down projections), giving $P_{\text{FFN}} = 3HI$ parameters. Each GEMV contributes $2HI$ FLOPs, so the exact total is $6HI$ — which this document uses throughout. The training scaling-law literature ([KAPLAN-SCALING], [CHINCHILLA]) uses $4HI$, which corresponds to a non-gated 2-matrix FFN with expansion ratio $4H$. Since this model targets **inference** of modern gated-MLP architectures (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral), we use the exact $6HI$ to ensure accurate compute-bound predictions (prefill TTFT, batched decode at $B > B^*$). With $6HI$ FLOPs and $3HI$ parameters, the FLOP-to-parameter ratio is exactly $2$ for every weight matrix, yielding the clean OI result $\text{OI} = 2/b$ without approximation.

Dense FFN layers always have $EP = 1$.

### MoE FFN FLOPs

For MoE layers, each token is routed to $k$ active experts (top-$k$ gating) [DEEPSPEED-MOE]; in practice $k=1$ [SWITCH] or $k=2$ [MIXTRAL]:

- the **router** is applied to the full hidden vector:
  $$
  F_{\text{router}} = 2 H N_{\text{exp}}
  $$
  where $N_{\text{exp}}$ is the total number of experts.

- for each of the $k$ selected experts for this token, the FFN computation is:
  $$
  F_{\text{expert}} = 6 H I_{\text{moe}}
  $$

Thus the MoE FFN FLOPs for one token in one layer are:

$$
F_{\text{ffn,moe}} =
F_{\text{router}}
+
k \cdot F_{\text{expert}} =
2 H N_{\text{exp}}
+
k (6 H I_{\text{moe}})
$$

### Unified FFN FLOP Term

We now define **effective FFN FLOP parameters**:

- Effective FFN “matrix” dimension:
  $$
  I_{\text{eff}} =
  \begin{cases}
  I_{\text{dense}}, & \text{dense layer}, \\
  k I_{\text{moe}}, & \text{MoE layer},
  \end{cases}
  $$

- Effective router multiplicity:
  $$
  N_{\text{eff}} =
  \begin{cases}
  0, & \text{dense layer}, \\
  N_{\text{exp}}, & \text{MoE layer}.
  \end{cases}
  $$

With these definitions, both dense and MoE FFN FLOPs can be written in a **single unified form**:

$$
F_{\text{ffn}} = 6H I_{\text{eff}} + 2H N_{\text{eff}}
$$

This matches:

- Dense layer:
  $F_{\text{ffn}} = 6H I_{\text{dense}} + 2H \cdot 0 = 6H I_{\text{dense}}$
- MoE layer:
  $F_{\text{ffn}} = 6H (k I_{\text{moe}}) + 2H N_{\text{exp}} = 6H I_{\text{moe}} k + 2H N_{\text{exp}}$

---

## 3.4 LayerNorm and Elementwise FLOPs

LayerNorm, RMSNorm, residual additions, and elementwise ops scale linearly with $H$ and are ~4 orders of magnitude smaller than the dominant FFN FLOPs for large models. We drop $F_{\text{norm}}$ from all per-device expressions. Norm overhead is an empirical correction handled in `framework.md`.

---

## 3.5 Per-Device FLOPs per Layer Under TP, SP, EP, and PP

For a single decoding token, the FLOPs for one transformer layer are:

$$
F_{\text{layer}}
\approx
F_{\text{proj}} + F_{\text{attn,KV}} + F_{\text{ffn}},
$$

where:

- $F_{\text{proj}} = 4H^2 + 4H H_{kv}$ (Section 3.1),
- $F_{\text{attn,KV}} = 4 S H$ (Section 3.2),
- $F_{\text{ffn}}$ is dense or MoE (Section 3.3).

$F_{\text{norm}}$ is dropped per Section 3.4.

To find **per-device FLOPs**, we apply sharding from TP, SP, EP and then multiply by the number of layers on the PP stage.

---

### TP (Tensor Parallelism)

TP shards all **GEMV/GEMM-like** FLOPs using column- and row-parallel linear layers [MEGATRON]:

- projections ($F_{\text{proj}}$),
- attention score/value FLOPs ($F_{\text{attn,KV}}$),
- FFN GEMMs (dense or MoE experts).

Thus:

$$
F_{\text{tensor}}^{\text{device}} = \frac{1}{TP} F_{\text{tensor}}
$$

---

### SP (Sequence Parallelism)

SP shards the **sequence dimension** across $SP$ ranks [MEGATRON3].  
Thus **only** the sequence-dependent FLOPs:

$$
F_{\text{attn,KV}} = 4 S H
$$

are reduced:

$$
F_{\text{attn,KV}}^{\text{device}} =
\frac{1}{TP \cdot SP}
(4 S H)
$$

SP does **not** reduce:

- $F_{\text{proj}}$ (single token),
- $F_{\text{ffn}}$ (dense or MoE),
- router FLOPs.

---

### EP (Expert Parallelism)

EP applies only to MoE layers:

- Router FLOPs use the full hidden state and are **not sharded**.
- Expert FFN GEMMs are sharded across EP:

$$
F_{\text{expert}}^{\text{device}} =
\frac{k}{EP} \,(6 H I_{\text{moe}})
$$

and may also be TP-sharded if FFN GEMMs follow the same path:

- If experts use TP GEMMs: divide by $TP$ again.
- If experts are **only EP-sharded**, do **not** include $1/TP$.

Dense layers always have $EP = 1$.

---

### PP (Pipeline Parallelism)

PP assigns whole layers to stages.  
Each device in a PP stage owns:

$$
\frac{L}{PP} \text{ layers}.
$$

Thus:

$$
F_{\text{token, device}}
\approx
\frac{L}{PP}
\left(
F_{\text{proj}}^{\text{device}} + F_{\text{attn,KV}}^{\text{device}} + F_{\text{ffn}}^{\text{device}}
\right)
$$

### Total Per-device FLOPs

Dropping the negligible $F_{\text{norm}}$ and also substituting everything yields the **final fully expanded expression** per-device FLOPs for a single decoded token:

$$
F_{\text{token,device}}
\;\approx\;
\frac{L}{PP}
\left(
\frac{4H^{2} + 4H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{6H I_{\text{eff}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\;+\;
\frac{4 S H}{TP \cdot SP}
\;+\;
2H N_{\text{eff}}
\right)
$$

For a **dense MLP model**: $I_{\text{eff}} = I_{\text{dense}},\quad N_{\text{eff}} = 0,\quad EP = 1$

For a **MoE model**: $I_{\text{eff}} = k I_{\text{moe}},\quad N_{\text{eff}} = N_{\text{exp}},\quad EP \ge 1$

### Mixed MoE/Dense Architectures

For mixed architectures, FLOPs are computed separately for dense and MoE layers:

$$
F_{\text{token,device}} =
F_{\text{dense,device}} + F_{\text{moe,device}}
$$

**Dense layer FLOPs** (per device, for all dense layers on this PP stage):

$$
F_{\text{dense,device}} =
\frac{L_{\text{dense}}}{PP}
\left(
\frac{4H^{2} + 4H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{6H I_{\text{dense}}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{4 S H}{TP \cdot SP}
\right)
$$

Note: Dense layers have no router FLOPs and use $EP = 1$.

**MoE layer FLOPs** (per device, for all MoE layers on this PP stage):

$$
F_{\text{moe,device}} =
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}
\left(
\frac{4H^{2} + 4H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{6H k I_{\text{moe}}}{TP \cdot EP}
\;+\;
\frac{4 S H}{TP \cdot SP}
\;+\;
2H N_{\text{exp}}
\right)
$$

Note: The router term $2H N_{\text{exp}}$ is unsharded (applied to the full hidden state before expert selection). Prefill FLOPs (the $O(S^2)$ regime) are covered in [prefill.md](prefill.md).

### LM head FLOPs

Mirroring the LM head traffic term in §2.1, the $H \to V$ projection is **column-parallel sharded by TP** along the vocab dimension and **lives only on the last PP stage** (stage $PP{-}1$). It is not divided by $L$, $PP$, $EP$, or $SP$. The per-step compute on stage $PP{-}1$ is:

$$
F_{\text{LM,step,device}}(B) = \frac{2 \, B \, H \, V}{TP} \quad \text{(stage } PP{-}1 \text{ only)}
$$

This scales linearly with $B$ (one $H \to V$ projection per sequence) and fires once per step, not per layer. It is bookkept as a separate additive term and combined with $T_{\text{LM},\theta,\text{device}}$ into a one-shot LM-head roofline $t_{\text{LM}}$ in §6 / §7; on stages $0..PP{-}2$ this term is zero.

### Per-step (batched) FLOPs

A decode step processes $B$ sequences concurrently and produces 1 new token per sequence. Compute scales linearly with $B$ (every sequence runs the full forward pass independently):

$$
F_{\text{step,device}}(B) \;=\; B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}
$$

This is the per-step, per-device FLOP count consumed in the roofline (§4). All downstream HW latency formulas (§4–§6) carry the $(B)$ argument explicitly.

# 4. Compute vs. Memory Bound (Roofline Model)

Sections 2 and 3 derived the **per-step memory traffic** $T_{\text{step,device}}^{\text{eff}}(B) = T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}}$ and the **per-step FLOPs per device** $F_{\text{step,device}}(B) = B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}$. The compute roofline divides FLOPs by sustained device throughput $R_{\text{GPU}}$ (FLOPs/s):

$$
t_{\text{compute}}(B) = \frac{F_{\text{step,device}}(B)}{R_{\text{GPU}}} = \frac{B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}}{R_{\text{GPU}}}
$$

The memory roofline opens up across the device's memory hierarchy. Modern accelerators expose an ordered list of memory tiers $i = 0, 1, \ldots, n-1$ (fastest first): single-tier HBM on H100 / B200, two-tier SRAM + LPDDR5 on d-Matrix Corsair, single-tier on-die SRAM on Groq LPU. A **placement policy** $\pi$ assigns weight and KV bytes to specific tiers, splitting $T_{\theta,\text{device}}$ into per-tier shares $T_{\theta,0}, \ldots, T_{\theta,n-1}$ and $T_{\text{KV},\text{device}}$ into $T_{\text{KV},0}, \ldots, T_{\text{KV},n-1}$. Each tier carries its own effective bandwidth $BW_{\text{eff},i} = BW_i \cdot \eta_{\beta,i}$ (peak rate deflated by a sustained-throughput contention factor $\eta_{\beta,i} \in (0, 1]$, see `sram.md §1.2`). The per-step memory time sums bytes-moved over per-tier bandwidth across all tiers:

$$
t_{\text{mem}}(B) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{T_{\theta,i} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV},i}}{BW_{\text{eff},i}}
$$

Per-tier first-byte latencies $\alpha_i$ are dropped here because they contribute well under 0.1% of $t_{\text{mem}}$ at decode-step granularity; the full $\alpha$–$\beta$ form is reinstated in small-read regimes (paged-attention block fetch, flash-style spill — see `sram.md §2.1`). Tier definitions, placement policies (greedy fastest-first, operator-pinned), and worked numerical examples for d-Matrix Corsair / B200 / Groq LPU live in `sram.md`; this document treats $T_{\theta,i}$ and $T_{\text{KV},i}$ as given inputs.

**Single-tier reduction.** When $n = 1$ — single-tier devices like H100 / B200 / Groq LPU, or any system modeled before opening up the tier list — the sum collapses to one term:

$$
t_{\text{mem}}(B) = \frac{T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}}}{BW_{\text{eff},0}}
\qquad (n = 1)
$$

with $BW_{\text{eff},0} \equiv BW_{\text{mem}}$. The Operational Intensity and $B^\star$ analyses below are written against this single-tier shorthand for compactness; the multi-tier crossover (weights and KV pinned to different tiers — d-Matrix Capacity Mode being the canonical example) is derived in `sram.md §2.2`.

$t_{\text{compute}}(B)$ is the time assuming unlimited memory bandwidth — linear in $B$ since every sequence contributes its own per-token FLOPs. $t_{\text{mem}}(B)$ is the time assuming compute is free — within each tier, weights amortize once per step (the $T_{\theta,i}$ terms are $B$-independent) while KV reads scale with $B$ (each sequence reads its own history). For long-context LLMs the $B \cdot T_{\text{KV},i}$ contribution summed across tiers is often dominant.

The per-step **local latency** on this PP stage is the roofline of the two:

$$
t_{\text{local}}(B) =
\max\bigl( t_{\text{compute}}(B),\; t_{\text{mem}}(B) \bigr)
$$

The asymmetric $B$-scaling of the two arms (compute linear in $B$; memory weights flat per tier, KV linear per tier) means the regime can flip with $B$ — characterized by the operational-intensity analysis below.

---

### Operational Intensity (Ops:Byte)

The **operational intensity** for decoding on this device is [ROOFLINE]:

$$
\text{OI}(B) =
\frac{F_{\text{step,device}}(B)}{T_{\text{step,device}}^{\text{eff}}(B)} =
\frac{B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}}{T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}}}
\quad \text{(FLOPs per byte)}
$$

For the **single-token, single-sequence** baseline ($B = 1$), the formula collapses to $\text{OI}(1) = F_{\text{token,device}} / (T_{\theta,\text{device}} + T_{\text{KV,device}})$, which establishes the fundamental memory-bound character of decode. As $B$ grows, $\text{OI}(B)$ rises (weight reads amortize across more sequences); the crossover-batch analysis is in the dedicated subsection below.

High-level interpretation:

- **High OI** → more FLOPs per byte → *compute-bound*
- **Low OI** → fewer FLOPs per byte → *memory-bound*

This rating is compared to the device’s memory-to-compute ratio (the ridge point):

$$
\frac{R_{\text{GPU}}}{BW_{\text{mem}}}
$$

If $\text{OI}(B) > R_{\text{GPU}} / BW_{\text{mem}}$ the step is **compute-bound** (and $t_{\text{local}}(B) = t_{\text{compute}}(B)$); otherwise it is **memory-bound** (and $t_{\text{local}}(B) = t_{\text{mem}}(B)$).

---

### Dominant-Term Approximation

In practice, the OI is often approximated using only the largest FLOP and traffic terms. With $B$ sequences per step and full TP / EP / SP sharding:

- Per-step FLOPs dominated by:
  $$
  B \cdot \max\!\left( \frac{2H^2}{TP},\; \frac{6H I_{\text{eff}}}{TP \cdot EP},\; \frac{4 S H}{TP \cdot SP} \right)
  $$

- Per-step memory traffic dominated by the KV term (each sequence reads its own KV history):
  $$
  B \cdot \frac{2 S H_{kv}}{TP \cdot SP}\, b
  $$

Thus for long-context decoding (attention FLOPs dominate the FLOP max):

$$
\text{OI}(B) \approx
\frac{B \cdot 4 S H / (TP \cdot SP)}{B \cdot 2 S H_{kv} / (TP \cdot SP)\, b}
= \frac{2H}{H_{kv}\, b}
$$

Both $B$ and $(TP \cdot SP)$ cancel — the OI is shape- and batch-independent in this regime. (The cancellation makes intuitive sense: every sequence reads its own KV and computes its own attention, so the per-sequence FLOP-to-byte ratio is what matters; sharding splits both terms identically.)

For MHA ($H_{kv} = H$), this reduces to $2/b$. For GQA models, $H/H_{kv} = n_q/n_{kv}$ amplifies the OI — e.g., for $n_q/n_{kv} = 8$ (LLaMA-3 70B) the OI is $16/b$. Even so, this is far below typical ridge points (~300 FLOPs/byte on H100), so long-context decode remains **memory-bound** in practice.

The short-context limit collapses to the same $2/b$ for a different reason: when weights dominate, FFN FLOPs $6HI_\text{eff}$ over FFN traffic $3HI_\text{eff} \cdot b$ also gives $2/b$. So the path-independent answer is **OI ≈ 2/b at $B=1$**, with $b$ being the only free knob.

---

### Compute-Bound Crossover ($B^\star$)

The full $\text{OI}(B) = B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}} / (T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}})$ has two limiting regimes:

**Memory-bound limit** ($B$ small, weight traffic dominates the denominator):

$$
\lim_{B \to 0} \text{OI}(B) =
\frac{B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}}{T_{\theta,\text{device}}}
\;\to\; 0
$$

At small $B$, the model is **weight-traffic-limited**. The $B = 1$ case recovers the single-token OI established above.

**Compute-bound limit** ($B$ large, KV traffic dominates the denominator):

$$
\lim_{B \to \infty} \text{OI}(B) =
\frac{F_{\text{token,device}}}{T_{\text{KV,device}}}
$$

At large $B$, KV cache reads dominate and the intensity saturates at this asymptotic ceiling.

**Ridge-point crossover.** The **crossover batch size** $B^\star$ is the point at which the roofline transitions from memory-bound to compute-bound. Setting $\text{OI}(B^\star) = R_{\text{GPU}} / BW_{\text{mem}}$ (the ridge point per [ROOFLINE]) and solving:

$$
B^\star =
\frac{T_{\theta,\text{device}} \cdot R_{\text{GPU}}}
     {F_{\text{token,device}} \cdot BW_{\text{mem}} - T_{\text{KV,device}} \cdot R_{\text{GPU}}}
$$

**Existence condition.** $B^\star$ is finite and positive iff the denominator is positive. Rearranging into ridge-point form:

$$
B^\star < \infty
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\frac{F_{\text{token,device}}}{T_{\text{KV,device}}} \;>\; \frac{R_{\text{GPU}}}{BW_{\text{mem}}} = R_{\text{ridge}}
$$

i.e., the **arithmetic intensity of KV traffic alone** (per-token FLOPs over per-sequence KV bytes) must exceed the device ridge point. Intuition: $\text{OI}(B)$ asymptotes to $F_{\text{token,device}} / T_{\text{KV,device}}$ as $B \to \infty$; if this asymptotic ceiling itself sits below $R_{\text{ridge}}$, the roofline is never crossed regardless of batch size.

**No-crossover regime.** When the inequality is violated — typical of very long contexts on small models, where $T_{\text{KV,device}}$ grows linearly in $S$ while $F_{\text{token,device}}$ stays fixed — decode remains memory-bound at every $B$, and $B^\star \to \infty$. In this regime batching still amortizes *weight* traffic ($T_{\theta,\text{device}} / B$ per token), which continues to reduce per-sequence TPOT, but it **cannot** push the step into the compute-bound zone; adding more sequences only adds linear KV bandwidth pressure until HBM saturates.

**Weight-dominated approximation.** When $T_{\text{KV,device}}$ is small relative to $T_{\theta,\text{device}} / B^\star$ (short-context decode where weight traffic dominates), $B^\star$ simplifies to:

$$
B^\star \;\approx\;
\frac{T_{\theta,\text{device}}}{F_{\text{token,device}}}
\cdot
\frac{R_{\text{GPU}}}{BW_{\text{mem}}}
\qquad (\text{weight-dominated regime})
$$

Intuitive interpretation: $T_{\theta,\text{device}} / F_{\text{token,device}}$ is the inverse single-token OI (bytes per FLOP), and $R_{\text{GPU}} / BW_{\text{mem}}$ is the ridge point (FLOPs per byte). Their product is the batch size at which weight reuse tips the balance from memory-bound to compute-bound.

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

# 5. Communication Time During Decoding

Section 4 defined the **local per-step latency** on each device as the roofline of compute and the multi-tier memory sum:

$$
t_{\text{local}}(B) = \max\!\bigl(t_{\text{compute}}(B),\; t_{\text{mem}}(B)\bigr),
\qquad
t_{\text{mem}}(B) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{T_{\theta,i} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV},i}}{BW_{\text{eff},i}}
$$

(Single-tier devices collapse the sum to one term, recovering $t_{\text{mem}}(B) = (T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}}) / BW_{\text{mem}}$ — see §4.) We now incorporate the **inter-device communication time** that arises during decoding under distributed parallelism. In the nested parallelism structure used throughout this document:

$$
\textbf{PP} \;\rightarrow\; \textbf{EP} \;\rightarrow\; \textbf{TP} \;\rightarrow\; \textbf{SP}
$$

each axis contributes its own per-token communication term. All communication costs follow the standard $\alpha$–$\beta$ latency model [ALPHA-BETA]:

$$
t_{\text{comm}} = \alpha + \frac{\text{message size}}{B_{\text{eff}}}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the collective or hop latency, and $B_{\text{eff}}$ is the sustained bandwidth of the communication path.

The parameters $\alpha$ and $B_{\text{eff}}$ in this model are not abstract: they are **topology-dependent physical properties** of the underlying interconnect. Different parallelism domains—TP, EP, SP, and PP—may be mapped to **different network fabrics** or different portions of the same physical topology (e.g., NVSwitch star within a node, 2D/3D torus across nodes, or hybrid switch-plus-fabric designs). Consequently, each collective type sees its own communication characteristics, with potentially different latency constants and effective bandwidths. To keep the analysis general, we denote these as $\alpha_{XP}$ and $B_{\text{eff},XP}$ for TP, EP, SP, and PP respectively. Their actual numerical values depend on the system’s physical layout, routing scheme, and bisection bandwidth properties (e.g., constant-hop NVSwitch vs. hop-scaling torus fabrics). The following sections therefore use $\alpha_{XP}$ and $B_{\text{eff},XP}$ as **collective-specific, topology-aware** parameters, to be instantiated according to the actual deployment mapping.

**Delegation to the `collectives/` explainer subseries.** The shipped collective primitives (ring AR, double binary tree AR, ring AG / RS, pairwise A2A on star; dim-decomposed ring and bisection-bound A2A on torus; hierarchical RS → sub-AR → AG; in-network reduction via NVLS / Quantum SHARP / Tomahawk Ultra) are cost-modeled in `collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md` (per-algorithm) and `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md` (star / torus / mesh), with hierarchical composition in `collectives/03_hierarchical_topologies.md`, in-network primitives in `collectives/04_in_network_collectives.md`, and contention coefficients $(\eta_\alpha, \eta_\beta)$ in `collectives/05_contention_and_congestion.md`; the cheatsheet at `collectives/00_summary.md` indexes all of these. This section instantiates those primitives with the decode-scale per-rank message sizes defined below; derivations and the $(\alpha_\text{sum}, BW_\text{min})$ tier-chain accumulation live there. The $\alpha_{XP}$ and $BW_{XP}$ values used below are the fabric-chain span quantities from `notation.md §7`.

### Message sizes and their shard structure

To remain consistent with the compute and memory models, we strictly define the payload size for each collective type. Note the distinction between *storage size* (sharded) and *communication payload* (often full-width). Each shape below is given per token; for a decode step of batch size $B$ the payload scales linearly as $B \times (\text{per-token shape})$ because activation bytes scale with the number of sequences in the step. KV-gather (SP) scales with the number of sequences whose KV must be gathered, i.e., also $\propto B$.

- **PP (Pipeline Parallel):**
  Uses **activation shards** of width $\approx H/TP$ per token. Per step: $B \cdot H/TP$.
  *Rationale:* High-performance PP (e.g., Megatron-LM) preserves TP rank alignment, so only the local TP shard needs to be forwarded to the next stage.

- **EP (Expert Parallel):**
  Uses **full activations** of width $k \cdot H$ per token. Per step: $B \cdot k \cdot H$.
  *Rationale:* MoE routing sends token activations to experts. While the traffic is bidirectional (Dispatch + Combine), we model this by applying a factor of 2 to the *collective steps* in Section 5.2 rather than doubling the base message size here.

- **TP (Tensor Parallel):**
  Uses **full hidden state vectors** of width $H$ per token. Per step: $B \cdot H$.
  *Rationale:* Row-Parallel matrix multiplication produces a vector of **partial sums** that has the full width $H$. These must be All-Reduced across ranks, requiring the transfer of the full vector, not a shard.

- **SP (Sequence Parallel):**
  Uses **KV-cache blocks** of size $\frac{S}{SP} \cdot \frac{2H_{kv}}{TP}$ per sequence. Per step: $B \cdot \frac{S}{SP} \cdot \frac{2H_{kv}}{TP}$.
  *Rationale:* Ring Attention streams the distributed KV blocks around the ring. With $B$ concurrent sequences per step, each sequence's KV shard is streamed independently.

## 5.1 Pipeline Parallel (PP) Hop

Pipeline Parallelism (PP) forwards activations from one pipeline stage to the next [MEGATRON3]. Because TP is nested inside PP, high-performance implementations (e.g., Megatron-LM PP, DeepSpeed PP, NVIDIA NeMo, and FasterTransformer) preserve the **TP rank alignment** across all PP stages. That is, TP rank $i$ in stage $s$ corresponds directly to TP rank $i$ in stage $s{+}1$.  

This alignment has an important consequence:  
**each device only needs to forward its own TP shard of the hidden state**, not a full $H$-dimensional vector. The full activation is conceptually transferred across the PP boundary, but it is split naturally across $TP$ separate device-to-device links.

Thus the PP hop behaves as a **single, shard-sized point-to-point transfer**, with message size $\approx H/TP$ per token. For a decode step processing $B$ sequences concurrently, the per-step payload scales linearly:

$$
t_{PP}(B) =
\alpha_{PP}
+
\frac{B \cdot (H/TP)\, b}{BW_{\text{PP}}}
$$

The α-term (single point-to-point latency) is paid once per hop regardless of payload; only the β-term scales with $B$. This shard-preserving PP design avoids the extra TP collectives that would be required if stages exchanged full activations and then re-sharded them. Maintaining TP rank consistency across stages therefore yields a significantly faster pipeline, and is the standard strategy in modern LLM training and inference systems.

**Tier-aware PP cost (nested-layout convention).** $\alpha_{PP}$ and $BW_{PP}$ above are *not* uniformly tier-0 fabric values. They are the latency and bandwidth of the **specific tier** the PP boundary physically crosses, which depends on where PP sits in the nested layout `DP → PP → EP → TP → SP` (innermost = highest-bandwidth tier). The framework's `partition_layout.assign_tier_per_axis` resolves a `(PartitionSpec, SystemSpec)` pair into a per-axis tier index by walking the fabric chain inner→outer, allocating each axis to the smallest tier whose cumulative reach holds the cumulative product of inner axes × this axis. For example, on d-Matrix squadrack (3-tier chain: 16 × 4 × 8):

- `PP=2, TP=8`: cumulative `8·2 = 16` ≤ tier-0 cap → **PP at tier 0** (pair-of-cards mesh, $\alpha=0.115$ μs, BW=64 GB/s).
- `PP=8, TP=8`: cumulative `8·8 = 64` ≤ tier-1 cap → **PP at tier 1** (PCIe, $\alpha=0.65$ μs).
- `PP=32, TP=8`: cumulative `8·32 = 256 > 64` → **PP at tier 2** (Ethernet, $\alpha=2.0$ μs, BW=50 GB/s).

On single-tier systems (e.g., NVL72), every axis collapses to tier 0 and the legacy tier-0 PP pricing is recovered exactly. The implementation is in `core/decode_model.py` and `core/prefill_model.py`; the helper lives at `core/primitives/partition_layout.py`. This is a worst-case-tier model — within a single PP cost call we use the *outermost* tier the boundary could possibly cross. A finer per-hop blend (some boundaries within tier 0, some across tier 1) is left as a future refinement; the worst-case form matches the conservative engineering view that "PP runs across servers" for sweeps where it does.

---

## 5.2 Expert Parallel (EP) All-to-All (MoE Dispatch and Combine)

MoE layers require exchanging token activations across the expert-parallel (EP) dimension via all-to-all routing [DEEPSPEED-MOE]. EP communication follows a **bidirectional dispatch-and-combine pattern**: token activations are routed from the source rank to the rank holding the selected expert (top-$k$), and the expert's output is then sent back to the source rank to be added to the residual stream. We model these as **two distinct A2A collectives per MoE layer** ($n_{EP} = 2$ in §5.5), each costing one single-direction A2A — this aligns the cost-model bookkeeping with the kernel-launch counter (§7.1), since dispatch and combine are also two separate NCCL API calls.

Let $k$ denote the number of active experts per token. Each direction carries a $kHb$ byte per-rank per-token payload; for a decode step of $B$ sequences the per-step payload is $B \cdot kHb$. The shipped A2A primitive is pairwise direct-send (NCCL on star; bisection-bound pairwise on torus). Bruck / log-hop A2A does **not** ship and does not appear in the cost — see `collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md §7` for the primitive derivations. On a star topology, the per-direction A2A cost is:

$$
t_{EP}(B) \;=\; (EP - 1)\,\alpha_{EP} \;+\; \frac{EP - 1}{EP} \cdot \frac{B \cdot k H \, b}{BW_{\text{EP}}}
$$

§5.5's per-layer accumulator multiplies this by $n_{EP} = 2$ to recover the full Dispatch + Combine cost. For torus EP fabrics, substitute the bisection-bound form of `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §3` with $M = B \cdot kHb$. For dense models ($EP = 1$), $t_{EP}(B) = 0$.

---

## 5.3 Tensor Parallel (TP) Communication

TP groups compute each layer in parallel across $TP$ devices using column- and row-parallel linear layers [MEGATRON]. The dominant collective is an **All-Reduce** at the end of the MLP (Row Parallel) and Attention (Output) blocks to sum partial results across ranks.

**Critical Note on Message Size:** unlike PP (which sends a shard), the TP All-Reduce operates on the **full hidden state vector** ($H$). Each device owns only a shard of the weights, but the partial output from Row Parallelism is a vector of size $H$ that must be reduced globally; the payload is $Hb$ bytes per token, not $(H/TP)b$. For a decode step of $B$ sequences the per-step payload is $B \cdot Hb$.

NCCL ships two AR algorithms on a star fabric — ring (large-$M$) and double binary tree (DBT, small-$M$). Selection is a manual tuner knob (`tuner.ar_algorithm`, default `"ring"`; see `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §2`). Both are pipelined and bandwidth-optimal; only the $n_\alpha$ coefficient differs. For the decode payload $M = B \cdot Hb$, the per-step, per-layer cost is:

$$
t_{TP}^{\text{ring}}(B) \;=\; 2(TP - 1)\,\alpha_{TP} \;+\; 2 \cdot \frac{TP - 1}{TP} \cdot \frac{B \cdot H b}{BW_{\text{TP}}}
$$

$$
t_{TP}^{\text{DBT}}(B) \;=\; 2\,\lceil \log_2 TP \rceil \cdot \alpha_{TP} \;+\; 2 \cdot \frac{TP - 1}{TP} \cdot \frac{B \cdot H b}{BW_{\text{TP}}}
$$

For torus TP fabrics (dim-decomposed ring, shipped on TPU / Trainium), substitute the torus AR form of `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §3` with $M = B \cdot Hb$. Derivation and the ring-vs-DBT empirical crossover behavior are in `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §2` (cost) and explainer `02 §2`.

---

## 5.4 Sequence Parallel (SP) Communication

Sequence Parallelism (SP) in inference typically refers to **Ring Attention** [RING-ATTN]. The KV cache is partitioned along the sequence dimension $S$; to compute attention for a new token the Query ($Q$) stays local and KV blocks rotate around the ring so that the local $Q$ attends to the full history. This is a **pass-KV** ring variant — the standard choice for KV-cache-dominated inference where KV is large relative to $Q$. (A pass-Q variant exists for training, where $Q$ is full-sequence; see [HUANG-CP-2024].)

The ring operation is effectively an **All-Gather** (streaming the distributed KV cache to every rank), not an All-Reduce. DeepSpeed-Ulysses [DEEPSPEED-ULYSSES] is an alternative SP approach using all-to-all instead of ring; unlike ring, it is bounded by the number of attention heads rather than the number of devices. Tree-based SP variants are theoretically possible but no production implementation ships them — KV shards are large and must be processed in sequence order. For modeling purposes, we assume **ring-style, pass-KV SP communication**, costed via the ring AG primitive of `collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md §6`.

### SP Ring Communication Latency

Each active sequence streams its own KV shard around the ring. With $B$ concurrent sequences per step, the per-rank payload is $M_\text{SP}(B) = B \cdot (S / SP) \cdot (2 H_{kv} / TP) \cdot b$. Substituting into the star ring AG cost of `collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md §6`:

$$
t_{SP}(B) \;=\; (SP - 1)\,\alpha_{SP} \;+\; (SP - 1) \cdot \frac{B \cdot (S / SP) \cdot (2 H_{kv} / TP) \cdot b}{BW_{\text{SP}}}
$$

The message size reflects TP and SP as orthogonal partitions of the head and sequence dimensions, with $B$ multiplying because each sequence in the batch independently gathers its own KV shard. For torus SP fabrics, use the torus AG form of `collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §3` with the same $M_\text{SP}(B)$.

**Decode overlap note:** in single-token decode, per-token compute time is small, so communication overlap with compute ($\rho$) is unlikely to be significant for SP. The unified $\rho$ in §6.2 applies to all collective traffic; if SP dominates the comm budget on a given config, calibrate $\rho$ down accordingly rather than zeroing it per-axis (the cost model has no per-axis $\rho$ knob).

---

## 5.5 Total Communication Time Per Step on a PP Stage

Sections 5.1–5.4 provide **per-step, per-layer** communication costs for each parallelism axis (TP, EP, SP), and a **per-step, per-hop** cost for PP. Each carries the $(B)$ argument explicitly: α-side stays constant in $B$ (one collective per layer per stage regardless of payload), β-side scales linearly. We now combine them into the total per-step communication time on a given pipeline-parallel (PP) stage.

### Per-layer vs. per-stage normalization

A Transformer layer contains exactly one Attention block and one MLP/MoE block. Each block triggers a fixed number of communication collectives, and within each layer, TP, EP, and SP collectives are strictly ordered:

- **Attention**
  - 1 TP collective (Output Projection)
  - 1 SP collective (if SP is enabled)

- **MLP (dense)**
  - 1 TP collective (Output Projection)

- **MoE block**
  - 2 EP all-to-all calls (Dispatch + Combine)
  - 1 TP collective (Expert Output Projection)

These collectives must complete before the token can advance to the next layer. Since a PP stage contains $L/PP$ *sequential* layers, the total communication work for that stage is:

- $n_{TP}$ TP collectives per layer  
- $n_{EP}$ EP collectives per layer (0 for dense layers, 2 for MoE layers — Dispatch and Combine)  
- $n_{SP}$ SP collectives per layer (1 if SP is enabled)

Because TP, EP, and SP operations within each layer depend on one another (e.g., TP → SP in attention and EP → TP in MoE), they are **strictly sequential** and do not overlap. Thus, the **per-step communication time accumulated over the entire PP stage** is:

$$
t_{\text{comm,stage}}(B) =
\frac{L}{PP}
\bigl(
n_{TP}\, t_{TP}(B)
+
n_{EP}\, t_{EP}(B)
+
n_{SP}\, t_{SP}(B)
\bigr)
$$

Where:

- $t_{EP}(B)$, $t_{TP}(B)$, $t_{SP}(B)$ are the **per-step, per-layer, per-call** communication costs given in Sections 5.2–5.4. For EP, $t_{EP}(B)$ is the single-direction A2A; the round-trip cost is recovered via $n_{EP} = 2$.
- $n_{TP}$ is typically **2** (one for Attention, one for FFN).
- $n_{EP}$ is **2** for MoE layers (Dispatch + Combine) and **0** for dense layers.
- $n_{SP}$ is **1** (occurs during Attention).

### Adding PP hop cost

The PP hop is different: it is a **per-step, per-hop** cost rather than a per-layer cost. A step's microbatch is forwarded once from PP stage $s$ to stage $s{+}1$, with latency $t_{PP}(B)$ as defined in Section 5.1.

Thus, the total per-step communication time for this stage is:

$$
t_{\text{comm}}(B) =
\frac{L}{PP}
\bigl(
n_{TP}\, t_{TP}(B)
+
n_{SP}\, t_{SP}(B)
\bigr)
+
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}
\bigl(
n_{EP}\, t_{EP}(B)
\bigr)
+
t_{PP}(B)
$$

### Interpretation

- The first term accumulates **TP and SP collectives** required by all $L/PP$ layers on this PP stage (both dense and MoE layers have attention blocks requiring these collectives).
- The second term accumulates **EP collectives** required only by the $L_{\text{moe}}/PP$ MoE layers on this PP stage. Dense layers do not require EP communication.
- The third term accounts for the **one PP hop** that forwards the step's microbatch to the next stage.
- This combined expression represents the **total communication work** per step for the stage. Whether this communication becomes the latency bottleneck or is hidden by overlap is addressed in Section 4's roofline-style model and Section 6's end-to-end pipeline analysis.

### Mixed MoE/Dense Architectures

For architectures where only some layers are MoE (e.g., $L_{\text{moe}} < L$), the EP communication cost is proportionally reduced. This is particularly important for models like DeepSeek-V2 or Mixtral variants that alternate between dense and MoE layers.

For a **pure dense model**: $L_{\text{moe}} = 0$, so the EP term vanishes entirely.

For a **pure MoE model**: $L_{\text{moe}} = L$, recovering the original formula.

### Summary of Collective Types and Message Sizes

| Parallelism | Occurs in | Collective Type | Calls/layer | Message Size (per device, per step) | Layer Types |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **PP** | between layers | point-to-point | 1 | $B\cdot(H/TP)\,b$ | All |
| **TP** | attn + FFN | all-reduce (ring/tree) | 2 | $B\cdot H\,b$ | All |
| **EP** | MoE FFN | all-to-all | 2 | $B\cdot kH\,b$ | MoE only |
| **SP** | attention | all-gather (ring) | 1 | $B\cdot(S/SP)\cdot (2H_{kv}/TP)\, b$ | All |

At $B=1$ these reduce to the classical single-token payloads. The B-factor reflects that a decode step processes $B$ activations concurrently, so each collective carries $B \times$ the per-token activation vector.

### Practical Guidance: Shipped Algorithm Selection

Each collective in this section uses the algorithm that is actually shipped on the target fabric; other algorithms (Bruck A2A, recursive-doubling AR, PAT AG) are reference-only and live in `modeling/collectives/01 App. B`. Selection rules:

- **TP All-Reduce:** NCCL ships both ring and double binary tree (DBT) on a star fabric; the choice is a manual tuner knob `tuner.ar_algorithm` (`collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §2`), default `"ring"`. On torus fabrics (TPU / Trainium), only dim-decomposed ring ships — the knob is ignored. Empirical crossover: DBT wins at small $M$, ring wins at large $M$ ([DEMYST-NCCL]).

- **EP All-to-All:** NCCL ships pairwise direct-send on a star; TPU / Trainium ships the bisection-bound pairwise form on a torus (`collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md §7`). Log-hop (Bruck) A2A is **not** shipped and does not appear in this section's formulas.

- **SP All-Gather:** Ring AG is the only shipped form in production inference stacks — KV shards are large and must be processed in sequence order, so tree variants are impractical. This applies to both star (`collectives/01_collective_algorithms.md §6`) and torus (`collectives/02_topology_mapping.md §3`).

See `collectives/00_summary.md §4–§7` for the full shipped-primitive inventory and per-topology cost formulas (including hierarchical RS → sub-AR → AG and in-network reduction); `collectives/05_contention_and_congestion.md` for the contention coefficients $(\eta_\alpha, \eta_\beta)$.

# 6. Partition Strategy and Hardware Latency

This chapter brings memory, compute, and communication together at the **per-stage** level. It produces $t_{\text{stage,hw}}$, the hardware-intrinsic GPU-side step time, and the HBM-feasibility constraint that gates which partitions are even runnable. Two axes are covered:

1. Feasible model partitioning via **HBM limits** (§6.1)
2. Local per-token latency via the **compute–memory roofline** plus collective overlap (§6.2)

§7 layers scheduling and software costs on top of $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$ to produce the user-observed metrics: it derives the pipeline bubble and kernel-launch overhead that turn $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$ into $t_{\text{step,user}}(B)$ (and the throughput metrics TPS / TTPS). TTFT is owned by `prefill.md`.

---

## 6.1 Model Partition Strategy from HBM Constraints

A parallel configuration $(DP, PP, EP, TP, SP)$ is **feasible** only if each device can store:

- its **parameter shard**,
- its **KV-cache shard**, and
- the **activation workspace** needed for a single decoding token,

within the available HBM capacity $M_{\text{HBM}}$.

We define the total per-device static footprint as

$$
M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}}(B) =
M_{\theta,\text{device}}
+
M_{\text{act,device}}(B)
+
M_{\text{KV,device}}(B)
\;\le\;
M_{\text{HBM}}
$$

Using the per-device memory expressions derived in Section 1, the **fully expanded** form for uniform architectures is:

$$
\frac{L}{PP}\;
\left[
\frac{2H^2 + 2 H H_{kv}}{TP}
\;+\;
\frac{3 H I N_{\text{exp}}}{TP \cdot EP}
+
\frac{2 S H_{kv}}{TP \cdot SP}
\right] b
+\;
B(4H + 2H_{kv}) b
+
\frac{V H}{TP} b
\le\;
M_{\text{HBM}}
$$

where:

- the bracketed term is the **intermediate PP-stage** footprint (parameters, activations, KV cache).
- and the final $\frac{V H}{TP} b$ term models the **worst-case embedding / LM-head overhead** on boundary PP stages.
- for a **dense MLP model**: $I = I_{\text{dense}}$, and $N_{\text{exp}} = EP = 1$.
- for a **MoE model**: $I = I_{\text{moe}}$, with $N_{\text{exp}} > 1$ and $EP \ge 1$.

For **mixed MoE/dense architectures**, the memory constraint uses the split formula from Section 1.4, where dense and MoE layer contributions are computed separately.

### Calculating DP for a Fixed Total HBM Capacity

The total Data Parallelism degree ($DP$) is constrained by both the total cluster size ($N_{\text{GPUs}}$) and the memory headroom available on each device.

1. **Memory Headroom Requirement:** $DP$ scaling is only possible if $M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}} \le M_{\text{HBM}}$ for the chosen inner sharding degrees ($PP, EP, TP, SP$).
2. **Replication Logic:** Each model replica requires a dedicated group of $PP \cdot EP \cdot TP \cdot SP$ devices.

Let $N_{\text{GPUs}}$ be the total number of devices in the cluster. The maximum achievable $DP$ count is:

$$
DP = \left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{GPUs}}}{PP \cdot EP \cdot TP \cdot SP} \right\rfloor
$$

**Physical Interpretation:**

- **Scaling Limit:** To increase $DP$ for higher throughput ($TTPS$), one must either add more total GPUs to the cluster or increase inner sharding (e.g., higher $PP$ or $SP$) to reduce $M_{\text{device}}^{\text{total}}$, though the latter consumes more devices per replica.
- **Footprint vs. Replica Count:** There is a direct trade-off: higher sharding degrees "thin out" the memory footprint per device to fit large context $S$ or large models, but they simultaneously reduce the number of independent replicas that can fit in a fixed cluster.

---

## 6.2 Local and Networking Per-Step Latency

All quantities below are **per step, per stage**, with $B$ sequences batched together in one decode iteration. They are restatements of the building blocks from §3–§5 with $B$ threaded explicitly.

### Compute-bound latency

$$
t_{\text{compute}}(B) =
\frac{B \cdot F_{\text{token,device}}}{R_{\text{GPU}}}
$$

### Memory-bandwidth-bound latency

Weights amortize once per step; KV reads scale with $B$ (§4):

$$
t_{\text{mem}}(B) =
\frac{T_{\theta,\text{device}} + B \cdot T_{\text{KV,device}}}{BW_{\text{mem}}}
$$

### Roofline local latency

$$
t_{\text{local}}(B) =
\max\bigl(t_{\text{compute}}(B),\; t_{\text{mem}}(B)\bigr)
$$

### Collective communication latency

From §5.5, with each per-axis $t_*(B)$ carrying its own $B$ scaling on the β-side:

$$
t_{\text{comm}}(B)
\approx
\frac{L}{PP}
\bigl(
n_{TP}\, t_{TP}(B) +
n_{SP}\, t_{SP}(B)
\bigr) +
\frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP}
\bigl(
n_{EP}\, t_{EP}(B)
\bigr) +
t_{PP}(B)
$$

Note: EP collectives only apply to MoE layers ($L_{\text{moe}}$), while TP and SP collectives apply to all layers.

### Unified Overlap Model

We introduce an overlap factor $\rho \in [0, 1]$ representing the fraction of local compute/memory time that is successfully utilized to hide communication.

The effective per-stage HW time is the local time plus any **unhidden** communication:

$$
t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) =
t_{\text{local}}(B)
+
\max\bigl(0,\; t_{\text{comm}}(B) - \rho \cdot t_{\text{local}}(B)\bigr)
$$

This is the GPU-side wall-clock cost of one pipeline stage processing one decode step's worth of $B$ sequences — purely **hardware-intrinsic** (compute + memory + interconnect, after collective overlap), no scheduling or SW overhead. §7 introduces the per-stage SW dispatch budget $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ (§7.1) and the pipeline bubble (§7.2) on top to produce the user-observed step time $t_{\text{step,user}}$ (§7.2).

**Regimes:**

- **$\rho = 0$ (No Overlap):**
  $$t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) = t_{\text{local}}(B) + t_{\text{comm}}(B)$$
  Typical for naive implementations or strictly sequential dependencies.

- **$\rho = 1$ (Perfect Overlap Opportunity):**
  $$t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) = t_{\text{local}}(B) + \max(0, t_{\text{comm}}(B) - t_{\text{local}}(B)) = \max(t_{\text{local}}(B), t_{\text{comm}}(B))$$
  Achieved by highly optimized kernels (e.g., Ring Attention) where independent work exists.

- **$0 < \rho < 1$ (Partial Overlap):**
  Models real-world overheads (synchronization barriers, partial dependency chains) that prevent utilizing the full local duration for hiding comms. Kernel-launch overhead is *not* part of $\rho$ here — it is modeled separately as $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ with its own overlap factor $\rho_{\text{SW}}$ in §7.1.

### LM head latency (stage PP-1 only)

The LM head $H \to V$ projection is a per-step one-shot kernel that fires only on the last PP stage. Its FLOPs ($2BHV/TP$, §3) and weight + output traffic ($T_{\text{LM},\theta,\text{device}} = HVb/TP$ from §2.1, plus output activations $B \cdot V \cdot b$) define a small standalone roofline:

$$
t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B) =
\max\!\left(
  \frac{2 B H V / TP}{R_{\text{GPU}}},\;
  \frac{H V b / TP + B V b}{BW_{\text{mem}}}
\right)
$$

Because the LM head lives on stage $PP{-}1$ only (not divided by $PP$, $EP$, or $SP$), it is bookkept as a separate additive term rather than folded into the per-layer $t_{\text{local}}(B)$. §7.2 composes it on top of the per-stage body cost as a stage-$PP{-}1$ surcharge — under the uniform-stage assumption this makes stage $PP{-}1$ the throughput bottleneck.

---

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

# 7. Kernel-Launch Overhead and Throughput

§6.2 produced $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$ (per-stage body) and $t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ (one-shot LM head on stage $PP{-}1$) — the **hardware-intrinsic** per-step time pieces at batch size $B$, the lower bound set by tensor-core compute, HBM bandwidth, and on-/off-chip interconnect. Two derived quantities follow directly from them:

- **Per-replica throughput bottleneck** $\max_j t_{\text{stage,hw},j}(B) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ — sets the steady-state output rate (tokens/s per replica): once the pipeline is full, the bottleneck stage (always $PP{-}1$ under uniform body) finishes a step every $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ seconds, so the user-observed token rate is gated by the slowest stage. This is the quantity that drives **TPS** in §7.2.
- **Pipeline traversal time** $\sum_{j=1}^{PP} t_{\text{stage,hw},j}(B) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ — the cost a token pays to walk all $PP$ stages once and then through the LM head. The *first* token of any sequence always pays this (the pipeline starts empty before prefill), so it is the primary HW-side contribution to **TTFT** (covered in prefill.md); subsequent decode steps pay only the bottleneck-stage cost once the pipeline is filled.

A real serving step does not run at this lower bound. Two SW/framework costs accrue on every token generation step on top of $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$:

1. **Kernel-launch overhead** — the host-CPU dispatch budget for the layer + collective + PP-hop kernels that fire each microbatch. Whether this is hidden by GPU work or surfaces as a hard floor depends on how well async dispatch overlaps with the GPU. §7.1 derives this as $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ — same per-step per-stage units as $t_{\text{stage,hw}}$, so the two compose into one effective per-stage cost. Note that $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ is **independent of $B$** — kernel launches pay $\tau_{\text{launch}}$ once per launch event, regardless of payload.
2. **Pipeline bubble** when the pipeline is underfilled — a scheduling-driven inefficiency that scales with $PP/B$ when $B < PP$. The bubble factor $\gamma_{\text{pp}}$ is a **global multiplier** on whatever per-stage cost dominates the round (HW or SW), so it sits *outside* the HW/SW composition rather than as a per-axis correction.

§7.2 assembles $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$, $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$, and $\gamma_{\text{pp}}$ into the user-observed step time $t_{\text{step,user}}(B)$ and the throughput metrics TPS / TTPS.

## 7.1 Kernel-launch overhead

The user-observed step time also includes a dispatch budget $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ — the cost of getting one microbatch's worth of kernels onto the GPU on this stage. Where that cost is paid depends on the execution mode: in **eager** mode it is literal CPU `cudaLaunchKernel` latency on the host side ($\tau_{\text{launch}} \approx 7\,\mu s$); under **CUDA Graphs / DAG replay** the host issues a single `cudaGraphLaunch` per microbatch and the per-node work shifts to the GPU's command processor walking the captured DAG ($\tau_{\text{launch}} \approx 1.5\,\mu s$, dominated by command-buffer overhead, not CPU API time). The framework collapses both regimes into a single $\tau_{\text{launch}}$ knob — the term name "SW overhead" is inherited from the eager-mode framing but applies to either path.

$t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ is **per microbatch, per stage** — same units as $t_{\text{stage,hw}}$ (§6.2), so the two compose directly in §7.2 without a unit mismatch. EP launches only fire on the $L_{\text{moe}}/PP$ MoE layers this stage owns (mirroring the $L_{\text{moe}}/PP$ factor in §5.5's $t_{\text{comm}}$ formula); for a pure dense model $L_{\text{moe}} = 0$ and the EP term vanishes.

$$
t_{\text{stage,sw}} = \tau_{\text{launch}} \cdot \left[ \frac{L}{PP} \bigl( k_{\text{compute}} + k_{\text{collective}}(n_{TP} + n_{SP}) \bigr) + \frac{L_{\text{moe}}}{PP} \cdot k_{\text{collective}} \cdot n_{EP} + k_{\text{pp\_hop}} \right]
$$

**What $k_{\text{compute}}$ counts.** $k_{\text{compute}}$ is the number of non-NCCL compute kernels fired per layer — GEMMs, attention, layernorms, activations, residuals. With a fused stack (FlashAttention + Megatron-style fused MLP) a decode layer fires roughly: (1) fused QKV projection, (2) FlashAttention forward, (3) output projection, (4) fused residual + post-attention norm, (5) fused gate + up + activation, (6) down projection, (7) residual. ~8–12 launches in production; default is 10. Aggressive ahead-of-time compilation (e.g. TensorRT engine) drops this to 3–5; eager-mode PyTorch without fusion can push it to 30+. Tighter compilation reduces $k_{\text{compute}}$; CUDA Graphs reduce $\tau_{\text{launch}}$ — these are independent levers and production stacks generally use both.

**Per-layer accounting — two nested layers for collectives.** $n_{TP}, n_{EP}, n_{SP}$ from §5.5 count *NCCL API calls* per layer (logical operations: e.g. $n_{TP} = 2$ means "two `ncclAllReduce` calls per layer — one in attn, one in MLP"). The $t_{\text{comm}}$ formula in §5.5 prices each call once via $n_* \cdot t_*$. The launch counter goes one level deeper: each NCCL API call internally fires $k_{\text{collective}}$ separate `cudaLaunchKernel` events (default 2 — typically a setup/coordination kernel plus the reduction kernel), so the *total kernel launches per layer per axis* is $n_* \cdot k_{\text{collective}}$. That product is what $\tau_{\text{launch}}$ is paid for. Custom collectives that fuse the call into a single kernel set $k_{\text{collective}} = 1$; multi-kernel implementations may set it higher. Each $n_*$ is zeroed when the corresponding axis size is 1 (the collective never fires).

Three additive contributions in the bracket: (1) compute + TP + SP launches on every layer this stage owns ($L/PP$ layers); (2) EP launches on MoE layers only ($L_{\text{moe}}/PP$ layers); (3) one P2P transit (default $k_{\text{pp\_hop}} = 2$: 1 recv + 1 send on a middle stage; edge stages do only one direction, off by half a launch — negligible at $PP > 1$). The PP-hop term is inert when $PP = 1$.

$t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ is composed with the GPU-side $t_{\text{stage,hw}}$ via the SW overlap factor $\rho_{\text{SW}} \in [0, 1]$ — at $\rho_{\text{SW}} = 1$ (the production default for CUDA-Graphs-replayed serving), async dispatch fully overlaps with GPU work and $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ acts as a *floor* that only kicks in when the per-microbatch launch budget exceeds $t_{\text{stage,hw}}$; at $\rho_{\text{SW}} = 0$, dispatch is synchronous and the costs add linearly. Setting `kernel_launch_us = 0` in the tuner zeros $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ entirely (legacy roofline behavior).

A separate Tensor Core efficiency term $\eta_{\text{TC}}(\text{mb})$ derates the compute roofline at small microbatch; with the default $\eta_{\text{TC}} = 1$ (no curve set in the tuner) this term is a no-op.

## 7.2 User-observed step time and throughput

### Saturated step time (no bubble)

When the pipeline is **fully saturated** ($B \ge PP$), every stage holds a different microbatch on every step and all $PP$ stages run in parallel. The user-observed step time then collapses to the slowest per-stage cost — the assembled HW + SW cost on the bottleneck stage, plus the LM head surcharge on stage $PP{-}1$, with no bubble penalty.

Composing $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$ (§6.2) and $t_{\text{stage,sw}}$ (§7.1) follows the same overlap pattern as the compute/comm overlap in §6.2: GPU work runs as the base, host dispatch overlaps for a fraction $\rho_{\text{SW}}$ of it, and any unhidden remainder serializes after. The LM head term $t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ from §6.2 then adds on top, since it fires once per step on stage $PP{-}1$ and is not hidden by the body roofline:

$$
t_{\text{step,user}}^{\text{sat}}(B) = t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + \max\!\bigl(0,\; t_{\text{stage,sw}} - \rho_{\text{SW}} \cdot t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)\bigr) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)
$$

Under the uniform-stage assumption (all $PP$ stages have identical body cost), the bottleneck stage is $PP{-}1$ and the additive $t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ exactly captures its extra workload. For $PP = 1$, this also collapses to "single-stage body + LM head".

**Regimes (assuming $\rho_{\text{SW}} = 1$, the default):**

- $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) \ge t_{\text{stage,sw}}$: the overflow term is 0, $t_{\text{step,user}}^{\text{sat}}(B) = t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ (HW-bound — async dispatch fully hidden by GPU work). This is the typical regime for moderate-to-large $B$ on production stacks.
- $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) < t_{\text{stage,sw}}$: $t_{\text{step,user}}^{\text{sat}}(B) = t_{\text{stage,sw}} + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ (SW-bound on the body — CPU cannot feed the GPU or kernel cannot run fast enough; common at small $B$ on dense decode where $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)$ shrinks below the fixed launch budget).
- $\rho_{\text{SW}} = 0$: no overlap, costs add: $t_{\text{step,user}}^{\text{sat}}(B) = t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + t_{\text{stage,sw}} + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$.

When $t_{\text{stage,sw}} = 0$ this is just $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$ (legacy roofline behavior plus the LM-head term).

### Pipeline bubble correction

The saturated form above assumes the pipeline is full. When it is not, the bubble factor inflates the step time. **How the PP pipeline works:** pipeline parallelism splits the model's $L$ layers into $PP$ contiguous stages, each owned by a different device (or device group). A token cannot skip stages — it is transformed by stage 0, then forwarded to stage 1, and so on through stage $PP{-}1$ before its logits are produced. To keep all stages busy in parallel, the batch of $B$ active sequences is split into microbatches that flow through the pipeline back-to-back: while stage 0 processes microbatch $i{+}1$, stage 1 is processing microbatch $i$, stage 2 is processing microbatch $i{-}1$, etc. This is the standard PP execution pattern from [MEGATRON3].

Two regimes follow from this picture, depending on whether there are enough microbatches in flight to keep every stage busy. The same scheduling logic applies to both HW and SW per-stage costs — the bubble doesn't care whether a stage is GPU- or SW-bound:

- **Pipeline full ($B \ge PP$).** Every stage runs a different microbatch in parallel; the saturated formula above holds. The full traversal cost $\sum_j t_{\text{stage,hw},j}(B)$ is paid only by the *first* token (TTFT, prefill.md), not by each subsequent decode step.
- **Pipeline underfilled ($B < PP$).** With fewer microbatches than stages, parallelism collapses: a single microbatch must walk all $PP$ stages in series before the user sees the next token, so both HW and SW step costs grow toward their traversal sums (with uniform stages and $B = 1$, these become $PP \cdot t_{\text{stage,hw}}(1)$ and $PP \cdot t_{\text{stage,sw}}$).

A first-order bubble correction captures both regimes with a single multiplier:

$$
\gamma_{\text{pp}} = \max\left(1,\; \frac{PP}{B}\right)
$$

At $B \ge PP$, $\gamma_{\text{pp}} = 1$ and the bubble vanishes. At $B = 1, PP > 1$ it equals $PP$. At $B = 1, PP = 1$ it also reduces to unity, recovering the non-pipelined decode model. Because $\gamma_{\text{pp}}$ scales the per-stage body costs (HW and SW) identically, it multiplies the body composition only; the LM head fires once per step on stage $PP{-}1$ regardless of bubble depth, so it is added outside $\gamma_{\text{pp}}$:

$$
t_{\text{step,user}}(B) = \gamma_{\text{pp}} \cdot \bigl[ t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B) + \max\!\bigl(0,\; t_{\text{stage,sw}} - \rho_{\text{SW}} \cdot t_{\text{stage,hw}}(B)\bigr) \bigr] + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)
$$

This is the full user-observed step time. At $B = 1, PP = 1$ with $t_{\text{stage,sw}} = 0$, it reduces to $t_{\text{stage,hw}}(1) + t_{\text{LM,hw}}(1)$ — single-stage body plus LM head, the non-pipelined decode model with a vocab projection at the end.

### Throughput (TPS, TTPS)

A single DP replica emits one token per sequence per step, so it outputs $B$ tokens every $t_{\text{step,user}}(B)$:

$$
TPS_{\text{single}}(B) = \frac{B}{t_{\text{step,user}}(B)}
$$

Across $DP$ fully independent replicas (no cross-replica coupling), the total cluster throughput scales linearly:

$$
TTPS(B) = DP \cdot TPS_{\text{single}}(B) = \frac{DP \cdot B}{t_{\text{step,user}}(B)}
$$

When $B \ge PP$ the bubble factor is unity and $TPS_{\text{single}}(B) = B / t_{\text{step,user}}^{\text{sat}}(B)$, recovering the classical "throughput is gated by the slowest stage" result — where the bottleneck stage is $PP{-}1$ and its cost is the SW-composed body plus the once-per-step LM head $t_{\text{LM,hw}}(B)$.
