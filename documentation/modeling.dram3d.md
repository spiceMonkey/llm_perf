## Introduction

Conventional HBM attaches DRAM dies to a logic die via through-silicon vias (TSVs) or microbumps, with interconnect pitches on the order of 10–55 µm; at these pitches the number of interface pins is limited by package geometry rather than die area. 3D stacking with hybrid bonding achieves far higher pad density — pitches of 0.5–2 µm — unlocking bandwidth that scales with die area rather than package perimeter. This document derives the effective memory bandwidth $B_{\text{eff,mem}}$ from first principles, following the methodology of AccelStack §III-C2 [ACCELSTACK]; §III-C2 gives the qualitative framework but contains no dedicated equation, so the derivation here is an original first-principles extension. The resulting $B_{\text{eff,mem}}$ feeds directly into `SystemSpec.device.hbm_bandwidth_GBps`, and from there into the roofline model of `modeling.tpot.md` §4.

# 1. Physical Interface Parameters

The model is parameterized by five physical quantities. All are observable from die specifications or packaging datasheets.

| Symbol | Description | Units | Example |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------|
| $A_{\text{die}}$ | DRAM die area (the face of one DRAM die bonded to the logic die) | mm² | 100 mm² |
| $p_{HB}$ | Hybrid bonding pitch: center-to-center spacing between adjacent pads | µm | 0.9 µm |
| $\eta_{\text{data}}$ | Data pin fraction: proportion of all pads used for data signals | dimensionless | 0.4 |
| $f_{\text{data}}$ | Data rate per pin | Gbps | 8 Gbps |
| $N_{\text{dies}}$ | Number of DRAM dies stacked on the logic die | integer | 4 |

**On pitch ranges.** Hybrid bonding allows pitches of 0.5–2 µm, compared to roughly 55 µm for C4 flip-chip bumps and ~10 µm for microbumps. At 1 µm pitch, a 100 mm² die supports on the order of $10^8$ pads — several orders of magnitude more than conventional packaging.

**On $\eta_{\text{data}}$.** Not all pads carry data. Power delivery, ground return, clock distribution, ECC check bits, and control/command signals collectively consume roughly 50–70 % of total pads in real DRAM designs. The data pin fraction $\eta_{\text{data}} \approx 0.3$–$0.5$ captures this allocation; a value of 0.4 is used as the default throughout this document.

# 2. Pin Count and Bandwidth Derivation

## 2.1 Step 1 — Total Pins from Die Area and Pitch

Pads are arranged in a 2D grid with spacing $p_{HB}$ in both the $x$ and $y$ directions. The number of grid points that fit within the die area $A_{\text{die}}$ is:

$$
N_{\text{pins,total}} = \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{die}}}{p_{HB}^2} \right\rfloor
$$

where $A_{\text{die}}$ and $p_{HB}$ must be expressed in consistent units (both in µm², or $A_{\text{die}}$ in µm² = $A_{\text{die,mm}^2} \times 10^6$). This is the theoretical maximum pad count, assuming full-area coverage.

## 2.2 Step 2 — Data Pins After Overhead Allocation

Of the $N_{\text{pins,total}}$ pads, only a fraction $\eta_{\text{data}}$ carries data:

$$
N_{\text{pins,data}} = \left\lfloor N_{\text{pins,total}} \cdot \eta_{\text{data}} \right\rfloor
$$

## 2.3 Step 3 — Bandwidth per Die

Each data pin runs at $f_{\text{data}}$ Gbps (gigabits per second). Converting to GB/s (gigabytes per second):

$$
BW_{\text{die}} = N_{\text{pins,data}} \times \frac{f_{\text{data}}}{8} \quad [\text{GB/s}]
$$

The factor of 8 converts from bits to bytes. Substituting Steps 1 and 2:

$$
\boxed{
BW_{\text{die}}
= \left\lfloor \left\lfloor \frac{A_{\text{die}}}{p_{HB}^2} \right\rfloor \cdot \eta_{\text{data}} \right\rfloor
\times \frac{f_{\text{data}}}{8}
\quad [\text{GB/s}]
}
$$

This is the bandwidth presented by a single DRAM die's interface to whatever it is bonded to — either the logic die (in Model A/B below) or the die below it in the stack.

## 2.4 Step 4 — Two Stacking Models

Whether additional dies in the stack contribute independent bandwidth depends on the physical integration topology. Two bounding models are presented.

### Model A — Conservative: Single Logic-Facing Interface

In this model, $N_{\text{dies}}$ DRAM dies are stacked vertically, but only the **bottom die** bonds directly to the logic die. Upper dies route their data through the bottom die's TSVs, and are therefore bottlenecked by the single bottom-die-to-logic-die interface. The memory controller sees one logical port regardless of stack height:

$$
\boxed{BW_{\text{conservative}} = BW_{\text{die}}}
$$

Stack height increases **capacity** ($N_{\text{dies}} \times$ capacity per die) but does not increase bandwidth in this model. This matches the HBM architecture, where each stack of 4 or 8 dies exposes a single 1024-bit wide interface to the package.

### Model B — Optimistic: Independent Per-Die Interfaces

In this model, each DRAM die has its own direct hybrid-bonded interface to the logic die (true 3D integration, where each die is individually bonded to a redistribution layer on the logic die's surface). Each die contributes independently:

$$
\boxed{BW_{\text{optimistic}} = N_{\text{dies}} \times BW_{\text{die}}}
$$

This is the theoretical upper bound for fully independent die-to-die connections. It requires that the logic die's surface have sufficient area to accommodate $N_{\text{dies}}$ separate DRAM footprints simultaneously.

### Bandwidth Bounds

$$
\boxed{BW_{\text{conservative}} \;\le\; B_{\text{eff,mem}} \;\le\; BW_{\text{optimistic}}}
$$

**Which model to use.** The AccelStack paper (§III-C2) does not resolve this question definitively [ACCELSTACK]. Practical 3D DRAM designs, including the Samsung HBM4 roadmap and near-term HBM4E architectures, indicate that the conservative model is more realistic: the bottom die becomes the bandwidth bottleneck and upper dies primarily add capacity. The conservative model is therefore the **default for `SystemSpec`**; the optimistic model serves as a research upper bound for future fully-disaggregated 3D integration.

# 3. Numerical Examples

## 3.1 Scenario 1 — HBM3E Baseline (Calibration)

This scenario calibrates the model against a known, shipping product (SK Hynix HBM3E) to validate the methodology and reveal where the assumptions break down.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| $A_{\text{die}}$ | 82 mm² (SK Hynix HBM3E die) |
| $p_{HB}$ | 55 µm (C4/microbump, not hybrid bonding) |
| $\eta_{\text{data}}$ | 0.5 |
| $f_{\text{data}}$ | 6.4 Gbps per pin |
| $N_{\text{dies}}$ | 4 |

**Computation:**

$$
N_{\text{pins,total}} = \left\lfloor \frac{82 \times 10^6\;\mu\text{m}^2}{(55\;\mu\text{m})^2} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor \frac{82{,}000{,}000}{3{,}025} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor 27{,}107 \right\rfloor
= 27{,}107
$$

$$
N_{\text{pins,data}} = \lfloor 27{,}107 \times 0.5 \rfloor = 13{,}553
$$

$$
BW_{\text{die}} = 13{,}553 \times \frac{6.4}{8} = 13{,}553 \times 0.8 \approx 10{,}842 \;\text{GB/s}
$$

**Reconciliation against datasheet.** Actual HBM3E delivers approximately 1.2 TB/s per 4-die stack — that is, ~300 GB/s per die — using a physical interface of 1,024 data pins per die at 6.4 Gbps per pin (per [HBM-SPEC]). The formula above predicts 13,553 data pins, whereas reality is 1,024. The discrepancy is a factor of ~13×, and the explanation is straightforward: **conventional HBM is pad-layout-limited, not area-limited.** At 55 µm microbump pitch, only 27,107 bumps fit in the die footprint in principle, but the actual HBM I/O design uses far fewer, fixed-position pads constrained by the PHY circuit layout and package routing — not by bump density. The area-based formula only becomes accurate when hybrid bonding enables true area-limited pad density. The key insight is: the 3D hybrid bonding model is meaningful precisely because it removes the pad-layout bottleneck.

## 3.2 Scenario 2 — Near-Term Hybrid Bonding ($p_{HB}$ = 2 µm)

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| $A_{\text{die}}$ | 100 mm² |
| $p_{HB}$ | 2 µm |
| $\eta_{\text{data}}$ | 0.4 |
| $f_{\text{data}}$ | 8 Gbps per pin |
| $N_{\text{dies}}$ | 4 |

**Computation:**

$$
N_{\text{pins,total}} = \left\lfloor \frac{100 \times 10^6}{(2)^2} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor \frac{100{,}000{,}000}{4} \right\rfloor
= 25{,}000{,}000
$$

$$
N_{\text{pins,data}} = \lfloor 25{,}000{,}000 \times 0.4 \rfloor = 10{,}000{,}000
$$

$$
BW_{\text{die}} = 10{,}000{,}000 \times \frac{8}{8} = 10{,}000{,}000 \;\text{GB/s} \cdot 10^{-3} = 10{,}000 \;\text{GB/s} = 10 \;\text{TB/s}
$$

**Results:**

$$
BW_{\text{conservative}} = 10 \;\text{TB/s} \quad (1\text{ interface, regardless of }N_{\text{dies}})
$$

$$
BW_{\text{optimistic}} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \;\text{TB/s} \quad (4\text{ independent interfaces})
$$

## 3.3 Scenario 3 — Aggressive Hybrid Bonding ($p_{HB}$ = 0.9 µm)

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| $A_{\text{die}}$ | 100 mm² |
| $p_{HB}$ | 0.9 µm |
| $\eta_{\text{data}}$ | 0.4 |
| $f_{\text{data}}$ | 8 Gbps per pin |
| $N_{\text{dies}}$ | 4 |

**Computation:**

$$
N_{\text{pins,total}} = \left\lfloor \frac{100 \times 10^6}{(0.9)^2} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor \frac{100{,}000{,}000}{0.81} \right\rfloor
= \left\lfloor 123{,}456{,}790 \right\rfloor
= 123{,}456{,}790
$$

$$
N_{\text{pins,data}} = \lfloor 123{,}456{,}790 \times 0.4 \rfloor = 49{,}382{,}716
$$

$$
BW_{\text{die}} = 49{,}382{,}716 \times \frac{8}{8} \approx 49{,}383 \;\text{GB/s} \approx 49 \;\text{TB/s}
$$

**Results:**

$$
BW_{\text{conservative}} \approx 49 \;\text{TB/s}
\qquad
BW_{\text{optimistic}} \approx 4 \times 49 = 197 \;\text{TB/s}
$$

**Caveats at aggressive pitch.** At 0.9 µm pitch the pin count approaches $1.2 \times 10^8$ per die, and the aggregate I/O power draw ($\sim N_{\text{pins,data}} \times f_{\text{data}} \times E_{\text{bit}}$) may exceed the power budget of the die interface. In practice, $f_{\text{data}}$ may need to drop to 2–4 Gbps per pin to remain within acceptable power density, reducing bandwidth proportionally. Signal integrity and reference voltage distribution at sub-µm pitch are additional practical constraints not captured by this first-principles model.

# 4. Latency Model

Shortening the vertical interconnect path in a 3D stack reduces access latency relative to HBM. Following AccelStack §III-C2 [ACCELSTACK]:

$$
\lat_{3D} \approx \frac{\lat_{\text{HBM}}}{k_{\text{interconnect}}}
$$

where $k_{\text{interconnect}} > 1$ is the latency reduction factor attributable to the shorter signal path (no interposer, no package trace, direct vertical bond). Typical HBM read latency is approximately 100 ns at the row-activation level [HBM-SPEC]. With hybrid bonding reducing the vertical path from ~100–200 µm (HBM microbump + interposer) to ~1–5 µm (direct bond), an estimated:

$$
k_{\text{interconnect}} = 2 \text{–} 5
\quad \Longrightarrow \quad
\lat_{3D} \approx 20 \text{–} 50 \;\text{ns}
$$

**Impact on LLM decode.** For steady-state decode with large weight tensors and sequential KV cache access, the system is strongly memory-**bandwidth**-bound, not latency-bound. The improved latency $\lat_{3D}$ does not affect $t_{\text{token}}$ in the roofline regime (see `modeling.tpot.md` §4). Latency reduction does matter for workloads with high spatial locality and frequent cache-miss patterns (e.g., sparse retrieval, tree-attention with irregular access), but those are outside the scope of the steady-state decode model.

# 5. Feeding into SystemSpec

The bandwidth bounds derived in §2 map directly to `DeviceSpec` fields in the llm_perf `SystemSpec`:

```python
DeviceSpec(
    hbm_bandwidth_GBps = BW_conservative,  # default: conservative model (single interface)
    # or BW_optimistic as research upper bound (independent per-die interfaces)
    hbm_capacity_GB    = N_dies * capacity_per_die_GB,
    peak_flops_TF      = ...,
)
```

The `hbm_bandwidth_GBps` value becomes $B_{\text{eff,mem}}$ in the roofline model (`modeling.tpot.md` §4). Specifically:

$$
t_{\text{mem}} = \frac{T_{\text{token,device}}^{\text{eff}}}{B_{\text{eff,mem}}}
\qquad
t_{\text{local}} = \max(t_{\text{compute}},\; t_{\text{mem}})
$$

A larger $B_{\text{eff,mem}}$ reduces $t_{\text{mem}}$, potentially shifting the operating regime from memory-bound to compute-bound. For a given LLM configuration, the regime boundary (ridge point) is at arithmetic intensity:

$$
I^* = \frac{R_{\text{GPU}}}{B_{\text{eff,mem}}}
$$

Increasing $B_{\text{eff,mem}}$ from 3.35 TB/s (H100 HBM3E, per [H100-SPEC]) toward 10 TB/s (Scenario 2 above) lowers $I^*$ by a factor of ~3×, meaning that workloads previously memory-bound may become compute-bound under 3D DRAM, and vice versa.

**Note on `hbm4e.512dev.json`.** The system spec at `llm_perf/database/system/hbm4e.512dev.json` specifies `hbm_bandwidth_GBps = 6400` (6.4 TB/s per device). This value sits between the H100 HBM3E baseline (3.35 TB/s, [H100-SPEC]) and the near-term hybrid bonding projection (Scenario 2: ~10 TB/s at $p_{HB} = 2\;\mu\text{m}$), making it a reasonable interpolation point for near-future HBM4E devices.

Back-calculating the required interconnect pitch to yield 6,400 GB/s from the §2 model ($A_{\text{die}} = 100\;\text{mm}^2$, $\eta_{\text{data}} = 0.4$, $f_{\text{data}} = 8$ Gbps):

$$
N_{\text{pins,data}} = \frac{BW_{\text{target}}}{f_{\text{data}}/8} = \frac{6{,}400}{1} = 6{,}400
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
N_{\text{pins,total}} = \frac{6{,}400}{0.4} = 16{,}000
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
p_{HB} = \sqrt{\frac{100 \times 10^6}{16{,}000}} \approx 79\;\mu\text{m}
$$

A pitch of ~79 µm is in the **microbump** range, not hybrid bonding. This means the 6,400 GB/s entry in `hbm4e.512dev.json` is an **aspirational placeholder** — a user-specified bandwidth target for a hypothetical HBM4E device — rather than a value derived from the 3D hybrid bonding model in §1–4. When using the dram3d model to project hybrid-bonding scenarios, the §3 numerical examples (Scenarios 1–3) are the physically grounded reference points.
